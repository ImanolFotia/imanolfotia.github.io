Hello there!\\
My name is Imanol, and I am Computer Engineer and graphics/game programmer.\\
I am currently developing my first game, usign my home made engine.\\
The game is called Insight, and I will be posting updates about its development here, and on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/imanolfotia).\\
Even though I have knowledge of various programming languages, the real deal for me is C++, specially C++11, so expect to see a lot of it around here.\\
By the way, you can talk to me in both English and Spanish(I have knowledge of Japanese, but I'm not there yet).\\
I am a big fan of Metal Gear Solid, The Lord Of The Rings and Heavy Metal(yes, in that order).
