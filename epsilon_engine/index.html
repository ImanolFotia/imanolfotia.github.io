<h2>Epsilon Engine</h2>

Epsilon Engine© is a multi-platform, next-gen, on-development game engine. It uses OpenGL© 4.5 capabilities to deliver stunning graphics with great real time performance.
It has been under development since 2015, and has constantly been catching up with the latest realtime, 3D techniques.
It started as an alternative for Valve's © Source Engine ©, in attemps to develop a horror game.
After game engines became more accesible for indie developers, Epsilon was in a short hitatus but it's development was quickly resumed.

<h3>Technology</h3>
Epsilon Engine© is written almost in it entiretely in C++. It takes advantage of latests OpenGL© 4.5 capabilities and ensures a seamless experience in both Windows© and GNU/Linux.
The engine is capable of simulate global illumination in real time.
Integration of post-processing effects is easy, thanks to it's flexible modular design. 
Because the engine uses a component based architecture, verything is an entity, and thus, models, sounds, effects, particles, etc, can be used to create a new entity, without having to write a single line of code to acchieve a new creation. To extend even further these capabilities, the Epsilon Engine uses the Lua script system, with the posibility of each entity having it's own script and therefore, behaviour.
