<h2><center>About Me</center></h2>

  Welcome to my personal page!
  <p></p>
  	  <p>Hello, my name is Imanol Fotia and this is my portfolio website. In this website you will find my past, current and future projects.
      One of my biggest passions of my life are videogames, both playing and making them, and I started the latter right after I began my Software Engineering carrer (that I have finished).</p>
      
      <p>But not only making the games are my objectives, I have spent the last years of my life researching and learning Graphics Programming and that has lead me to make my own engine.</p>


      <p>I looking forward to venture in this amazing industry of entertaiment as a game developer.</p>
